Training to create stateful React Component

Creating sophisticated UI in a typical ASP .NET MVC core project is always a big chalenge.
React is only the ‘V’ part of MVC and as such is not opinionated in how you architect your UI.

If proper attention is not given, a reasonably large react app can quickly succumb to a mess of stateful components, each with a mind of it’s own, quickly violating the react way of doing things.
There are several key points one must keep in mind while building with React:

1-Stateless components

2-Composition

3-Centralised state management with Redux.
